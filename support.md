## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does Equinox calculate sunrise and sunset times?                                  
Equinox uses precise astronomical algorithms (NOAA solar calculator) combined with your location to calculate accurate sunrise and sunset times.

### Why does the app need my location?                                                    
Your location is needed to calculate accurate sun times for where you are. Your location data stays on your device and is never sent to external servers.                          
   
### Can I add multiple locations?                                                         
Yes! Tap the + button to search for and add any city. Swipe between locations on the Today tab.                                                                                     

### How do I enable the widget?                                                           
Long-press on your home screen, tap the + button, search for "Equinox", and choose the small or medium widget.                                                                   

### The sunrise/sunset times seem wrong                                                   
Make sure you've granted location access, or try adding your city manually for the most accurate results.
